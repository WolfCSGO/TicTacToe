<h2> Introduction</h2>
This project was created in the course <strong>Enfoca't.</strong> </br>
It's programmed in <strong>Java</strong> with the IDE Netbeans 8.2.</br> </br>

<h2> Why is this project here? </h2>
It's uploaded to GitHub because we are learning to use Git. With this project here, we can learn what happens when two group members
 change the same file and try to push the changes to the server or create different branches and merge them. The 
 most important it's that we are improving the application co-working.
